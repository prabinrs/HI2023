## Practicum

We introduced how to draw deep network schematics conveniently using diagrams.net. Then we showed the different effect of using only linear transformation, and the effect of combining linear and non-linear transformation together on spiral classification. Finally, we showed the mathematical principles underlying neural networks, including chain rule derivation, back propagation, and gradient descent.
