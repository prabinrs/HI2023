## Lecture part B


## Practicum
We started with an application of autoencoders: DALL-E.  We discussed Autoencoders (in terms of Energy-Based Models) and their use cases. Next, we discussed the reconstruction costs and the loss functions we should use. Finally, we discussed a particular type of autoencoder, i.e., denoising autoencoder.
